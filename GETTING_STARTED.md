# Deployment Guide ü™Ç

**[üè†Home](README.md)**

This open-source solution interacts with the Print Queue on the SAP backend via the SAP OData service [API_CLOUD_PRINT_PULL_SRV](https://api.sap.com/api/API_CLOUD_PRINT_PULL_SRV/overview) and dispatches the requests to Microsoft Universal Print managed printers via the [Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/print?view=graph-rest-1.0).

This project is setup with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for automated provisioning.

## Pre-requisitesüìú

### Azure

- **Entra ID Tenant**
- **Azure Subscription**

### Microsoft Universal Print

- **Microsoft Universal Print License**: Learn More About Licensing and included free requests [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-license).
- **Registered Printers**: At least one physical printer registered in [Microsoft Universal Print](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Universal_Print/MainMenuBlade/~/Overview). Check the [Printer Registration Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-printer-registration) for details.

### SAP System

- **SAP NetWeaver**: Minimum SAP_BASIS release 7.57 or above. This applies to S/4HANA 2022 or newer, and S/4HANA Cloud public edition.
- **SAP Print Queue Management**: Activate this feature in SAP by implementing the updates provided in [SAP Note](https://me.sap.com/notes/3348799) by applying the corrections in the note.
- **Authorized SAP User**: An individual empowered with the rights to generate and oversee spool requests and print queues, ensuring a smooth and secure printing process.

> [!NOTE]
> Consider implementing the SAP Cloud Print Manager to troubleshoot the SAP Print Queue component. Instructions are detailed in the attached PDF of [SAP Note](https://me.sap.com/notes/3420465).

## Configure backend printing solutionüõ†Ô∏è

The backend printing solution operates like a well-oiled machine, with two main components working in harmony:

**1. Deployment Infrastructure (Control Plane)**: Think of this as the conductor of an orchestra, overseeing the setup and ensuring that all parts of the printing process are perfectly tuned and ready for action.
**2. Backend Print Worker (Workload Plane)**: This is the musician of the group, diligently reading the music (spool requests) and playing the notes (sending print jobs) to the Universal Print devices with precision and care.

### Control Plane

The control plane is primarily responsible for managing the infrastructure state of the backend print worker and the Azure resources. The control plane is deployed using setup scripts and consists of the following components:

- **Persistent Storage**: A safe place for all Terraform state files, keeping track of your infrastructure‚Äôs blueprint.
- **Container Registry**: A digital library where the backend print worker‚Äôs image is stored, ready to be deployed.

### Workload Plane

The workload plane is where the action happens. It‚Äôs all about processing those print jobs, and it‚Äôs set up using Terraform. Here‚Äôs what it includes:

- **App Service Plan & Function App**: The stage where the backend print worker performs.
- **Application Insights**: An optional but keen observer for monitoring the backend print worker‚Äôs performance.
- **Key Vault**: A secure vault for all your secrets and sensitive information.
- **Storage Account**: The warehouse for managing print jobs.
- **Logic App & Custom Connector**: The messengers that ensure print jobs are delivered to Universal Print devices.
- **API Connection**: The bridge that connects the Logic App to the Universal Print API.
- **Managed Identity**: The backstage pass for the Function App, granting access to the Key Vault and Storage Account.

### Deploy the backend print solution

1. **Start Your Engines**: Head over to the Azure portal and fire up the Azure Cloud Shell (Powershell).
2. **Script Time**: Create a new file in the Cloud Shell editor. Copy and paste the below script (setup.ps1) into it. Make sure to tweak the parameters so they fit your SAP environment like a glove.

Once the script does its thing, you‚Äôll have both the control plane and the backend print worker neatly deployed in your Azure subscription.

```powershell
# Control Plane Environment Code is used to create unique names for control plane resources
$Env:CONTROL_PLANE_ENVIRONMENT_CODE="CTRL"
# Workload Environment Name is used to create unique names for workload resources
$Env:WORKLOAD_ENV_NAME="PROD"
# Location is the Azure region where the resources will be deployed
$Env:LOCATION="eastus"
$Env:ARM_TENANT_ID = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
$Env:AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = "yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy"
# SAP Virtual Network ID where the SAP systems are deployed
$Env:SAP_VIRTUAL_NETWORK_ID = "/subscriptions/yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy/resourceGroups/SAP/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/SAP-VNET"
# Address prefix for the subnet where the backend printing service will be deployed
$Env:BGPRINT_SUBNET_ADDRESS_PREFIX = "0.0.0.0/24"
# Enable logging on the Azure Function App
$Env:ENABLE_LOGGING_ON_FUNCTION_APP = "false"
# Home Drive for the azure user. This is the location you see when you are in the Azure Cloud Shell. Example: /home/john
$Env:HOMEDRIVE = "/home/azureuser"

$UniqueIdentifier = Read-Host "Please provide an identifier that makes the service principal names unique, for exaple (MGMT/CTRL)"

$confirmation = Read-Host "Do you want to create a new Application registration for Control Plane (needed for the Web Application) y/n?"
if ($confirmation -eq 'y') {
    $Env:CONTROL_PLANE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME = $UniqueIdentifier + "-SAP-PRINT-APP"
}
else {
    $Env:CONTROL_PLANE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME = Read-Host "Please provide the Application registration name"
}

$ENV:SAPPRINT_PATH = Join-Path -Path $Env:HOMEDRIVE -ChildPath "SAP-PRINT"
if (-not (Test-Path -Path $ENV:SAPPRINT_PATH)) {
    New-Item -Path $ENV:SAPPRINT_PATH -Type Directory | Out-Null
}

Set-Location -Path $ENV:SAPPRINT_PATH

Get-ChildItem -Path $ENV:SAPPRINT_PATH -Recurse | Remove-Item -Force -Recurse

$scriptUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/universal-print-for-sap-starter-pack/main/deployer/scripts/install_backend_printing.ps1"
$scriptPath = Join-Path -Path $ENV:SAPPRINT_PATH -ChildPath "install_backend_printing.ps1"

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $scriptUrl -OutFile $scriptPath

Invoke-Expression -Command $scriptPath
```

3. **Connect the Dots**: Jump to the workload plane resource group in the Azure portal. Find the API connection resource and hit the ‚ÄúEdit API connection‚Äù button. Then, give the green light by clicking ‚ÄúAuthorize‚Äù to link up with the Universal Print API.

4. **Function App**: Now, take a stroll to the Function App and find the validator function on the overview screen. Click on ‚ÄúCode + Test‚Äù. Ready to connect the SAP? Hit the ‚ÄúTest/Run‚Äù button. In the body section, drop in the JSON payload provided below and press ‚ÄúRun‚Äù. If you see a happy ‚Äú200 OK‚Äù response code, you‚Äôre all set! If not, the error message will give you clues to fix any hiccups.
   
```json
{
    "sap_environment" : "PROD",
    "sap_sid": "SID",
    "sap_hostname": "http://10.186.102.6:8001",
    "sap_user": "sapuser",
    "sap_password": "sappassword",
    "sap_print_queues": [
        {
            "queue_name":"ZQ1",
            "print_share_id": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
        },
        {
            "queue_name":"ZQ2",
            "print_share_id": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Paramaters**

| Name  | Description | Type | Example
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| sap_environment | SAP landscape environment | string | "PROD" |
| sap_sid | SAP system identifier | string | "SID" |
| sap_hostname | SAP primary application server hostname or IP address with http protocol and port number | string | "http://full.qualified.domainname:8001" |
| sap_user | SAP User with proper authorization | string | "USERNAME" |  
| sap_password | Password for the SAP user  | string | "password"
| sap_print_queues | List of print queue and Universal Printer Share mapping | list[map] | [{"queue_name":"ZQ1","print_share_id": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"}

5. **Test Drive**: It‚Äôs time to put the backend print worker to the test. Create a spool request in SAP and direct it to the print queue you‚Äôve set up in the Cloud Print Manager. The backend print worker will grab the spool request and whisk it away to the Universal Print device.

Repeat step 4 and 5 for each SAP environment you want to connect to the backend print worker.

## Ready, Set, PrintüöÄ

With everything in place, you‚Äôre ready to start printing from SAP to Azure‚Äôs Universal Print. It‚Äôs a game-changer for large-scale printing needs!
