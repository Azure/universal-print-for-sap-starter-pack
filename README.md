# SAP Printing with Microsoft Universal Print

Printing from SAP landscapes is a requirement for many customers. Examples can be data list printing, mass- or label printing. Such production and batch print scenarios are often solved with specialized hardware, drivers, and printing solutions. 

We distinguish between end-user-based printing from SAPGUI, web browsers, and web-based SAP front end apps. We refer to those use cases as frontend printing. See this Microsoft Learn page for more details on how to set that up with SAP. 

Unattended mass-print jobs initiated by apps rather than people we refer to as backend printing. Follow [this guide](GETTING_STARTED.md) to get started.
