# SAP Printing with Microsoft Universal Print

Printing from SAP landscapes is a requirement for many customers. Examples can be data list printing, mass- or label printing. Such production and batch print scenarios are often solved with specialized hardware, drivers, and printing solutions.

[Microsoft Universal Print](https://learn.microsoft.com/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-whatis) is a cloud-based print solution that enables organizations to manage printers and printer drivers in a centralized manner. Removes the need to use dedicated printer servers and available for use by company employees and applications.

For SAP, we distinguish between:

1. **Frontend Printing**: End-user-based printing from SAPGUI, web browsers, and web-based SAP front end apps like Fiori. See [this Microsoft Learn page](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sap/workloads/universal-print-sap-frontend) for more details. 
2. **Backend Printing**: the powerhouse behind large-scale, automated print jobs that are triggered by applications, not people. You can effortlessly deploy this solution within your Azure subscription and tailor it to your SAP system using Terraform. Follow [the deployment guide](GETTING_STARTED.md) in this repos to get started.
