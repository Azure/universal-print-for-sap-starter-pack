**How to scale Universal Print during high loads?**

Universal Print is a cloud-based service that scales automatically. The service is designed to handle high loads and is managed by Microsoft. See the limits and quotas [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-limits). Furthermore, see the [Microsoft Graph API throttling guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/throttling).

The overall integration solution can be scaled individually by adjusting the Azure resources. For example, you can increase the service plan of the Azure Function. See more details [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale).
